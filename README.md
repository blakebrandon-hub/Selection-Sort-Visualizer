# 🧠 Selection Sort Visualizer

**⚠️ Epilepsy Warning:** This visualization contains flashing elements and may not be suitable for individuals with photosensitive epilepsy.

A Python project that visually demonstrates the Selection Sort algorithm step by step.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blakebrandon-hub/Selection-Sort-Visualizer.git
   cd Selection-Sort-Visualizer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have `pygame` installed. If not, install it using:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Run the Visualizer:**

   ```bash
   python visualizer.py
   ```

   A window will open, displaying the selection sort process.

## 🧪 How It Works

- **Array Generation:** Creates an array of random values to be sorted.
- **Selection Sort Algorithm:** Highlights the current minimum value and distinguishes elements being compared.
- **Animations:** Swaps are animated to show the movement of elements, providing a clear understanding of the sorting process.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Library:** Pygame for visualization
