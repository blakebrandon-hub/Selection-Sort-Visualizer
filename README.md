## Overview

This project provides a visual representation of the selection sort algorithm, illustrating how it processes and sorts an array step by step.

## Features

- **Visual Representation**: Observe the selection sort algorithm as it operates on an array.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Follow each iteration and swap performed by the algorithm.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for those learning about sorting algorithms and their mechanics.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

To install Pygame, run:


pip install pygame

## How to Run ##
  1. Clone the repository

  git clone https://github.com/blakebrandon-hub/Selection-Sort-Visualizer.git
  cd Selection-Sort-Visualizer

  2. Run The visualizer

  python visualizer.py

  The visualization window will open, displaying the selection sort process.

  How It Works
The visualizer creates an array of random values and sorts them using the selection sort algorithm. During the process:

The current minimum value is highlighted.

Elements being compared are visually distinguished.

Swaps are animated to show the movement of elements.
